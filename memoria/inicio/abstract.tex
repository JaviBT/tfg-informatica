This undergraduate thesis studies the use of Computer Vision for pavement condition detection. In particular, the objective is to develop a baseline system capable of generalizing on pavement images. The work begins with an introduction to the problem being addressed and the motivation behind using technologies such as Computer Vision to solve it. A study of the state of the art in pavement damage detection and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model family is presented. Next, the evaluation framework and the development methodology used in the project are detailed. Finally, the iterative experiments conducted, the results obtained, and the conclusions and future work derived from the experiments are presented.
